### Summary

**Enhancing Productivity With AI Tools** 

Pete discussed the use of AI tools like password managers and collaborative Markdown editors to enhance productivity and collaboration. He highlighted the importance of sharing knowledge and the benefits of using GPD 4 over 3.5. Pete also suggested the potential of using an OpenAI API key, although he noted it could be costly. He further mentioned a python script he's developing with a friend to chunk up text and feed it to GPT-4 for tasks like spell checking. Lastly, Pete suggested Cori might benefit from a more controlled approach to their system's setup. 

**Gum Road and Desktop Publishing Workflow** 

Pete discussed his desktop publishing workflow, which involves selecting images and assembling them into an email newsletter using Gum road. He explained his use of Gum road as a platform for selling digital products and running AI courses. Pete also demonstrated his process of creating and editing products on Gum road, including adding emails. The discussion also touched upon the use of Markdown, with Pete likening it to a useful tool for navigating different apps. 

**Markdown for Text Management and Chat Systems** 

Pete and R discussed the benefits of learning Markdown for structuring messages in chat systems and commenting platforms. Pete demonstrated basic uses of Markdown, such as making text bold and creating headers, and suggested continuous practice and using Markdown in note-taking to retain knowledge. They also discussed the use of Markdown in text management systems like Obsidian, with Pete sharing his personal experience and emphasizing its use for enhancing readability. Towards the end, they briefly touched upon the use of Markdown in chat GPT to help the system understand the context of the message. 

**API Key, Obsidian, Notion, and OneNote Discussion** 

Pete demonstrated the use of an API key and its role in accessing various models on a platform. He also shared his use of Obsidian for password management and text generation. Noemi expressed interest in learning how to export chats from the web interface. Cori mentioned using Chat GPT and starting to use Notion, while R asked about Obsidian. Pete shared his observations about the differences between Obsidian, Notion, and OneNote, concluding that each tool offers unique benefits. 

**Obsidian Software Discussion: Advantages and Concerns** 

Pete discussed the advantages of using Obsidian, a software that operates on a computer and is free for personal use. He emphasized that it offers additional benefits compared to other tools like Notion, which has a paywall. Pete also highlighted the open-source nature of Obsidian. However, he acknowledged concerns raised by R about the software's long-term sustainability since it is not open-source. Pete suggested alternatives like Pulsar or Vs Code, which are open-source and function similarly to Obsidian. 

**Obsidian User Experience and Learning Curve** 

Pete and R discussed the user experience of the Obsidian platform. Pete highlighted its plain text file system and the ease of use, and mentioned a course he's developing to help users get started. R raised concerns about the learning curve, suggesting users should try the interface first. Pete proposed the use of a virtual buddy to install and test various software applications, and demonstrated the process of installing Obsidian on a fresh Mac. He also mentioned the potential for using virtual buddy for different workflows, despite some overhead in terms of CPU, storage, and other resources. Pete emphasized the importance of persisting with Obsidian and using it alongside other tools, and recommended using beginner's guides on YouTube for additional learning resources. 

**Exploring Markdown and Obsidian Tool Ecosystem** 

Pete introduced the concept of using Markdown in Obsidian, a tool he is not very familiar with. He then discussed the concept of assigning shortcut keys in Obsidian, another tool he uses. Pete also touched on the importance of exploring the functions within each sidebar, such as backlinks, forward links, tags, and outlines. He emphasized the usefulness of this ecosystem for users who are not familiar with Markdown. Pete also demonstrated how to use the tool, including how to format text, create bullet points, and indent. He also mentioned that users can drag items over to the tool and save them. 

**Obsidian, Finder, and Text Editors** 

Pete discussed the use of Markdown files and text files on his computer. He demonstrated how to search for and rename files using the Finder. Pete also showed how to open these files with different text editors and how to save changes made in these editors back to the file. He noted that Obsidian, a note-taking application, is compatible with other applications and can handle a variety of file types. Pete also compared Obsidian with other text editors like Typora, noting that Obsidian can sync files and pick up changes made in other editors. He suggested that users should start using their tools as soon as possible and experiment with different setups. 

**Managing AI Images and Obsidian Tool Usage** 

Pete shared his approach to managing large amounts of AI images using an external drive and a tool called the Chat to Exporter. This tool enables users to export individual or all conversations as Markdown files, which can be imported into Obsidian, a personal knowledge management, website building, and productivity tool. Pete emphasized the ease of using Obsidian and the benefits of its OBSIIDAN system. He also discussed the potential security concerns of using the GPT export feature and suggested the possibility of fixing a broken plugin. Towards the end, he planned to demonstrate how to use the Phoenix tool for viewing images. 

**Storage and Backup: Importance and Trade-Offs** 

Pete discussed his experience with storage, emphasizing the importance of using trusted brands and keeping important files on at least two hard drives. He introduced his new external hard drive and stressed the need for safely ejecting it before unplugging. Pete also touched on the benefits and trade-offs of solid state drives (SSDs), highlighting their ruggedness and speed. He discussed the possibility of building his own external SSD drive using computer components. Pete stressed the need for data backup and storage, recommending the use of SSD or spinning hard drives, and the importance of UPS for power outages. However, no clear decision or next step was reached by the end of the meeting.
