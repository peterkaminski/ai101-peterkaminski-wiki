## AI Summary (hopefully useful, may be inaccurate)

### Quick Recap

Pete Kaminski led a discussion about various tools and techniques for note-taking and collaboration during meetings, including Hackam and Obsidian Hackam. He also shared his experience with AI salon and how to use Chat Gpt for learning programming. Pete emphasized the importance of computational thinking and its application in solving complex problems. He also discussed the OpenAI API and its associated costs, as well as the potential benefits of self-directed learning through platforms like Github. 
### Summary

**Collaborative Note-Taking and AI Salon Tools Discussed** 

R J and Pete discussed the use of Hackam, a tool that facilitates collaborative note-taking during meetings. Pete demonstrated its use and discussed other tools like Obsidian Hackam, which are used to manage text files marked up with Markdown. These tools are used to take notes during calls, which can then be saved, uploaded, and transformed into a website using a tool called Massive Wiki Builder. Pete also discussed his AI salon, emphasizing its free non-commercial use. He shared his process of writing a Python program with Chat gpt and uploading it to obsidian. He invited others to contribute if they have experience with Markdown, obsidian, Git, or Github. Pete also suggested the use of tags and lists to keep track of pages and files. He provided Scott Arndt with suggestions on how to start with Obsidian, recommending to visit the AI One on One site and navigate from there, as well as downloading Obsidian from obsidian.md. He also mentioned that there are some introductory videos available for purchase. 

**ChatGpt's Effectiveness in Learning Programming** 

Pete Kaminski led a discussion about the value of using Chat Gpt for learning programming and other subjects. He emphasized the effectiveness of Chat Gpt in understanding programming basics and encouraged questions to clarify any misunderstandings. Pete discussed the differences between Spanish and English words, his experience learning accounting through ChatGpt, and the importance of understanding general programming concepts before learning a specific language like Python. He also highlighted the differences between the free and paid versions of Chat Gpt, suggesting that users should consider upgrading to the paid version for better answers and a deeper understanding, hinting at a potential hack to achieve this upgrade. 

**Gpt. 4 and Front-End Tools Discussion** 

Pete Kaminski discussed the use of Gpt. 4 and its API version, emphasizing the need for a front-end tool such as Mac Gpt. He mentioned the possibility of using Microsoft's Copilot as a free alternative. Pete also introduced a tool called "Diagram Style" or "Draw I/O" for drawing diagrams and shared his approach to using tools, preferring ones that are low-cost or open source. The conversation later shifted to a program called "Mac Gpt" and Pete's experience in creating a front end for Chat Gpt. Towards the end, Brandon Tidd suggested using Zoom's whiteboard, but Pete clarified that it doesn't work in Google Meet. 

**OpenAI API Costs and Mobile Accessibility Discussed** 

Pete Kaminski discussed the OpenAI API and its associated costs. He explained the concept of tokens and their pricing structure, noting that it was very affordable at 1 cent per 1,000 tokens. Pete also mentioned the potential for using the API on a mobile device, although he acknowledged that this would require some technical skill and might not be as user-friendly. He also suggested that there could be existing apps or third-party services that allow for API access on a mobile device, though he didn't provide specific examples. Towards the end of the meeting, he mentioned some additional functionalities that could be unlocked with an OpenAI API key, including a plugin for a tool called Obsidian. 

**Computational Thinking in Curriculums** 

Pete Kaminski discussed the concept of computational thinking, which he described as a useful skill even for those who do not program computers. He traced the origins of this concept to Jeanette Wing, a computer scientist who proposed its inclusion in broader curriculums in 2006. Pete explained that computational thinking involves breaking down complex problems into simpler ones and then guiding a computer through solving them. He suggested that understanding and applying computational thinking could help people solve problems more effectively, especially those they don't know how to solve yet. 

**AI and Creative Process: Breaking Down Complexity** 

Pete Kaminski discussed his experience with Chat gpt, an AI tool, and how it can be used to break down complex tasks, such as planning a cultural festival, into smaller, manageable parts. He also explored the application of computational thinking to image creation and expressed his dissatisfaction with an AI system that did not provide the depth he desired. Pete emphasized the importance of clear communication, starting over when necessary, and the synchronicity between his creative process and the AI's decomposition of the image. He also touched on the challenges of explaining concepts like pattern recognition and abstraction. 

**Self-Directed Learning vs. Traditional Schooling: Pros and Cons** 

Pete Kaminski and Julia Jack discussed the potential benefits of self-directed learning through platforms like Github versus traditional schooling. Pete pointed out that schooling offers accreditation that can impress hiring managers and provides external motivation to learn. He suggested that self-directed learning could be an appealing option if these aspects are not crucial. Julia Jack, however, raised questions about the necessity of learning specific programming languages and if showcasing her work on Github would be sufficient. Pete acknowledged the potential downsides of self-directed learning, such as the lack of structure and external motivation, and proposed using AI tools like Chat Gpt for guidance and comparison of different learning methods. 

**Obsidian and Github for Personal Development and Sharing** 

Pete Kaminski explained his organizational system using Obsidian, a tool that acts like a digital school notebook for personal development and work-related activities. He stressed the importance of keeping track of learning and work activities for future reference. He also mentioned that he would back up his notes to Github, not for sharing but for backup purposes, and he uses Github mainly for sharing code. Julia Jack clarified that Github is used for sharing software, not text-based notes. The discussion concluded with Pete encouraging people to ask questions and provide feedback in the channel for future topics.
