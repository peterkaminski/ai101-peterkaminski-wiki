# Learning more about REST APIs

_Up to topic: [[API]]_

An API is used by computer systems to exchange data and perform operations, and can be used by GPTs to look up specialized information or to integrate with other platforms. To learn more about APIs:

1. Find the API documentation for the platform you want to integrate with. Read and understand what the platform can do for you. Note that the platform may or may not offer the capabilities you want through their API. Also, find out if you need an API key or other authentication, and how to get it.
2. APIs can be implemented in many different ways. But the most popular type of API, and the type that GPTs integrate with, is known as a "REST API". So, search for **"learn REST API"** for general information on how they work. For historical reasons, you will also see the term "RESTful API", it means pretty much the same thing by now. Also read the Wikipedia article, **[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)**. Stay away from "SOAP", it is an older type of API that is probably not what you want.
3. GPTs need the API to be documented with an API schema using a format called "OpenAPI" (note the extra "P" for "API", not AI). So, search for **"learn OpenAPI"**. You'll also see "OAS", for "OpenAPI specification", that's the documentation that defines OpenAPI.
4. OpenAPI evolved from "Swagger". So also search for **"learn Swagger"**.

Using APIs is an advanced software development practice, so when you start using APIs, congratulations -- you're a software developer. If you need help, consider asking for help on developer forums, or even consider hiring someone on Fiverr, Freelancer, Upwork, etc. to get you and your project off the ground.

Some keywords to add, along with "REST API":
