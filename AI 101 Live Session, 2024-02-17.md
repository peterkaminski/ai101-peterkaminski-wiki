### Summary

**Exploring AI in Education: Gum Road and Beyond** 

Pete shared his team's experience in finding a suitable AI platform for delivering educational content, eventually settling on Gum Road. Patsy showed interest in the future of AI in education and the potential of other platforms such as Coursera and EdX. They discussed the potential of AI technology for problem-solving and improving people's lives. Patsy recommended Pete to explore a new interactive learning platform, Clicked, which might be related to their work. They also reflected on their past experiences and the fun they had together. 

**Obsidian, Markdown, and Computational Thinking** 

Pete discussed his use of the text-based tool, Obsidian, for note-taking, collaboration, and website building. He demonstrated its use, including its application of Markdown language for formatting. Pete shared his practice of using Obsidian for organizing information from AI 101 sessions, taking notes during meetings, and sharing them on his website. He also discussed the concept of computational thinking, a methodology that breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. Pete argued that this approach should be included in educational curricula as it is applicable beyond software development. He also explained the process of creating and publishing content on his website using Github and Netlify. Pete also mentioned an unofficial plugin for exporting chat conversations in Markdown and the availability of community plugins for Obsidian. 

**Chat GPT Usage and Economical Options Discussed** 

Pete discussed the various ways to use Chat GPT, including through the command line and a different front end. He mentioned that while the latter method costs $20 per month, it offers increased productivity. Pete also introduced the idea of using the same engine through a different front end, which could be obtained by purchasing an API key from Openai. He further explained that this method allows users to pay per word instead of a monthly fee, which he found more economical. Finally, in response to Daniele's inquiry, Pete confirmed that he was using Chrome as his browser. 

**Technology Adoption and Computer Skills** 

Pete was explaining the use of a plugin and its potential implications, while Daniele was present but focused on running errands. Pete emphasized the importance of learning computer skills and AI, even if it seems complicated initially, as it leads to increased productivity and ease of use in the future. He mentioned the availability of Chat Gbt as a resource for understanding technical aspects. The conversation also touched on the idea of being an early adopter of new technology and the benefits it brings. 

**Website Publishing Tools Discussion** 

Pete discussed his use of the free version of a tool called nullify, which he uses to publish websites. He mentioned that he has a dozen or so websites he publishes through nullify, and while it's a free tier, it has limitations. He also discussed the possibility of using another tool called Massive Wiki builder, although he noted that it's still being updated and he's unsure if it suits his needs. Pete also mentioned a tool called Chatbot UI, which he's modified to suit his needs. He explained that he's not sure if he can recommend either tool yet due to their changing nature. Lastly, he discussed a plugin called Tamper Monkey, which lets users interact with web pages, and mentioned that he's used it for the Chat GPT exporter and a discord history tracker. 

**Hacking and Browser Security Concerns** 

Pete discussed the concept of white and black hat hacking, explaining the evolution of the term "hacker" and its association with the press. He highlighted the ability to modify websites using tools like Tamper Monkey, allowing users to adjust or add features on websites like Facebook. Pete emphasized the importance of caution when using such tools, as they can potentially compromise the user's privacy and security by altering how the web browser operates. He also mentioned the existence of multiple app stores for user scripts and the need for users to be aware of what the scripts are doing. 

**Chat GPT Exporter and Tamper Monkey Usage Discussed** 

Pete discussed the use of Chat Gpt Exporter and Tamper Monkey, highlighting potential issues and requirements for non-technical users. He recommended against using Chat Gpt Exporter for non-technical users due to its complexity and the risks involved. Pete also noted that Tamper Monkey, while widely used, requires a certain level of technical understanding. He further explained that Chat Gpt Exporter only runs on specific websites and that its functionality is dependent on Openai's web UI, which could change and necessitate code adjustments. Despite these potential issues, Pete shared his personal positive experiences with these tools. 

**Computational Thinking and Chat Tools Discussion** 

Pete discussed the concept of computational thinking, emphasizing its history and application in teaching. He explained how it was introduced by Jeanette Wing and built upon by Seymour Papert. Pete also shared his personal experience with a tool called Chat T for learning and teaching computational thinking and demonstrated how to export conversations from Chat T. He also discussed potential issues with archiving conversations on Chat Openai chat gpt. Pete then shifted the conversation to the Chat Gbt exporter, a tool he found daunting but recommended to non-technical people with caution. He explained how to check the tool's status on a website and stressed the need for caution, disclaiming any responsibility for potential issues. 

**API Development and AI Integration Discussion** 

Pete and Patsy discussed the development of an API and the integration of AI technology. Pete proposed a demonstration of the stitching process with APIs and a GPT using Python. They acknowledged the existence of similar services offered by companies like Zapier. Pete also suggested the OpenAI API could be written by Chat GPT, allowing users to send files to OpenAI and receive results. The discussion concluded with plans to focus on the building blocks of AI in their next session. Pete also emphasized the superior performance of GPT-4 compared to other language models, suggesting its potential worth for use. He also recommended an LLM called Mama file that can operate independently even without internet connectivity. 

**Language Learning Models: Potential and Limitations** 

Pete discussed the use of Language Learning Models (LLMs), specifically recommending GPT-4 over GPT-3.5. He suggested using LLMs extensively, even for simple tasks, to test their limits and highlighted that they don't have common sense but have descriptions of it. Pete emphasized the importance of context when using technical terms and the transformational potential of LLMs in businesses. He encouraged experimentation with a new technology, Chat Gbd Plus account, to enhance daily work tasks and suggested that the technology assists users in their work processes. Pete promised to upload a recording of the session along with summaries for further reference and suggested repeating the discussion in the future. Patsy, Daniele, and the Dr. expressed their appreciation for the information shared.
