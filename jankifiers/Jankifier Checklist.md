# Jankifier Checklist

To be published here, jankifiers should have:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` as the first line.
- Copyright notice in an HTML comment after that.
- `<title>` and `<h1>` with the name and version.
- Optionally, a link to the Jankifiers page on the web.
- A short description of how to work it and what it does.
- A readable copyright notice in a `<div class="footer">` at the bottom.
- Optional, but nice: open source licensing along with the copyright.
