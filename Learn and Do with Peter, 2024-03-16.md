### Summary

**Maintaining AI Website and Massive Wiki Features**

Pete discussed the importance of maintaining the AI one-on-one website and outlined plans to use obsidian for presentations and image prompting. He highlighted the ease of learning a massive wiki publishing system and demonstrated how to help maintain the website. Pete also introduced a new feature in his YouTube videos, chapters, for better viewer navigation and discussed the concept of Massive Wiki, a collaborative website. He mentioned a related website, Mouse of Wiki, and another, Developer Dot Massive W, where the team has been working on improving Massive Wiki. Pete also discussed the process of installing and testing Get on a fresh Mac using virtual buddy and emphasized the importance of recording information for future use. 

**Homebrew Tool and Obsidian Discussion** 

Pete discussed the installation and use of the Homebrew tool on Macs and considered the creation of a flow diagram to simplify the process. He also explored the use of Obsidian for personal note-taking and team collaboration, highlighting its benefits such as ease of movement, sharing, and future-proofing. Pete then introduced the idea of participating in anonymous analytics but expressed concerns over trust issues. In the end, he successfully installed 'Brew' and discussed the next steps which include the installation of the Github cli tool. 

**Github Sign-in and Navigation Instructions** 

Pete provided instructions on how to sign into Github and navigate its system, emphasizing not to let its complexity intimidate users. He demonstrated the process of logging in, copying his username, and setting up two-factor authentication. Noemi briefly interrupted, apologizing for her audio issues. Pete then resumed his instructions, explaining how to execute a command in the terminal to authenticate with Github credentials. He stressed the difference between logging into Github on a computer versus logging into its web site. The conversation ended on a light-hearted note as Pete shared his bravery in asking his wife to pause her dishwashing task. 

**Website Maintenance With Github and Obsidian Demo** 

Pete discussed the process of maintaining a website integrated with Github, demonstrating how to install and use Obsidian, a content management system. He emphasized the importance of copying the repository link and encountered a problem with Github authorization, which he later resolved. He also demonstrated how to navigate through previous commands and use the 'copy and paste' function, stressing the need to grant trust to the device. Towards the end, he guided the team through the setup process of a new Obsidian vault, including installing community plugins, and how to edit and save changes using the Github interface. Scott inquired about setting up a Github account, to which Pete responded that he only needed to send his handle to be added as a collaborator. Pete mentioned there were some minor issues with the instructions that needed to be addressed in the coming week. 
Image Generation and Interleaver Tool Discussion 
Pete discussed the possibility of generating images using an API, but decided against it due to the technical aspects involved. Instead, he shared his experimentation with image prompting and the use of random prompts to create unique images. He introduced a tool called "interleaver", which he developed to mix two different descriptive scenes and create a new, unique image. Pete also mentioned that he wrote a post-Python app that interfaces with Chat Gpt and can be used to create a web UI. He encouraged others to download and run the interleaver tool from Github. 
Interleaver Tool Demonstration and Future Enhancements 
Pete demonstrated the use of a tool called Interleaver, which combines two prompts to create a new one. He explained that this method can generate unique and diverse results, unlike traditional prompts. Pete also suggested the possibility of adding more features to the tool, such as sending prompts to an AI system for image generation. He emphasized the benefits of learning how to use these tools, comparing it to learning software development. Pete ended the conversation by suggesting further experimentation with style, ref, and character ref, and mentioned the potential of using Midjourney with other AI systems. 
Visual Prompts and Image Manipulation 
Pete discussed the process of generating and experimenting with visual prompts. He shared his method of creating 10 prompts, each a visual description of a captivating scene, followed by 10 random words. He also experimented with nonsense haikus and adding the name of a classical art style to each prompt. Pete then moved on to using a web interface to create and manipulate images using different styles and characters. He explored the tool's features, such as locking images, and shared his approach of using multiple random elements to generate unique results. 
Web Interface Design and Image Management 
Pete emphasized the importance of character and style references in web interfaces, suggesting ways to adjust the default settings and experiment with different prompts. He proposed a joint activity of creating and sharing these prompts. Pete also discussed the importance of character references, recommending they should be full face, well lit, and preferably with a full body and clothes. He demonstrated to Claire how to download images from a particular website and manage the downloaded files. Towards the end, he shared tips on using Chrome profiles to manage downloads and uploaded the downloaded images into Google Drive, sharing the link in the channel for Claire to access. The conversation ended with Pete promising to set up the next meeting with earlier times.
