# Jankifier Betterification Project

_Last updated: 2024-04-24, PK_

Jankifiers have been really successful, I think. I'm getting ready to think of a next step with them: **Betterification!**

We **have** to keep the utter simplicity and memorability of the basic prompt: **Write a single html file with javascript. Let the user enter some text. When the user presses the "YOUR BUTTON NAME HERE" button, WHAT YOU WANT TO HAPPEN. Display the output and copy it to the clipboard. Don't show an alert. Let me download the html file.**

But we also want some add-ons:

- A "Jankifier Gallery", with icons for each jankifier, to make it easier and more fun to start a jankifier.
	- icon for jankifier
	- before/after images
	- to make a separate jankifier subdomain or domain
- Copyright, attribution, open source dedication (in progress)  
- Standardization of interface (early ones don't copy to clipboard automatically)  
- Slightly improved appearance (mostly some simple CSS improvements)  
- Better appearance on mobile (jankifying on a phone can be really satisfying, but right now it's too hard just because of the janky basic HTML)  
  
And I have a wonderful new idea to add:  
  
- A "Paste from clipboard" button! A one-button way to paste the clipboard into the input text box would make it a lot easier and quicker to chain jankifiers, which is super fun.  
  
I think we can do these level-ups, **and** make sure we don't lose the start-up simplicity.  
  
I'll start setting up and thinking of this as a project, that will take weeks to do. But setting up some goals, docs, etc., and making incremental progress will cause it to happen! WDYT? Any other burning needs for Jankifiers 2.0? (Or at least 1.1+, lol.)  
  
P.S. We'll still keep on making new jankifiers! I've got some cool ones in the wings as we speak.
