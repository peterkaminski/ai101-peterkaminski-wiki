# Permutation Prompts for Midjourney

For Midjourney users, [Permutation Prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/permutations) still work in the web interface, as well as the Discord interface.  
  
To do permutations, set to fast mode or add --fast, then put different terms in curly braces `{ }`, with each different term separated by commas.  
  
For example, here's a prompt with two different permutations:  
  
**a {happy, sad, remarkable, ordinary} painting from the {Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Symbolism, Art Nouveau} period, well-known painter, museum quality**  
  
That means, generate with **40** different prompts -- 4 feelings for each of the 10 styles!  
  
You can vary parameters, too, which is a good way to run an experiment with `--chaos` or `--weird`, or to vary aspect ratios.  
  
Obviously, be careful with this trick if you _don't_ have lots of GPU time to burn!
