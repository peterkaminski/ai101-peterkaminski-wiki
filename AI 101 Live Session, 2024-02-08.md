## AI Summary (hopefully useful, may be inaccurate)

### Quick Recap

The team discussed their experiences with various outlining tools, with R J transitioning to Log Seek and Pete sharing his use of Obsidian for managing files and information in AI projects. Pete also introduced a static site generator he wrote that can convert an Obsidian workspace into a website. The conversation also touched on Gpt. 4 and potential alternatives, including Gpt. 5, with Pete suggesting trying Gpt. 5 through its API for more control. The team also discussed the importance of having a GitHub account, particularly for those in the tech industry, and the complexity of Github. Towards the end, they discussed the Exf tool, its functionality, and how to use it.
### Summary

**Outlining Tools and Knowledge Management Systems** 

Pete Kaminski and R J discussed their experiences with various outlining tools. R J transitioned from Notepad Plus Plus to Log Seek, appreciating its capabilities for organizing different types of media. Pete introduced a shared link to meeting notes and shared his involvement in a community focused on knowledge management systems. He also discussed the use of Obsidian for managing files and information in AI projects and mentioned a static site generator he wrote that can convert an Obsidian workspace into a website. Jim Sharpe brought up an issue he experienced with the context window size in Gem, with Pete acknowledging the issue but not providing a solution. They also discussed their experiences with Gpt. 4 and potential alternatives, including Gpt. 5, with Pete suggesting trying Gpt. 5 through its API for more control. 

**GitHub and Obsidian Vaults in Tech Industry** 

Pete Kaminski emphasized the importance of having a GitHub account, particularly for those in the tech industry. He explained the platform's role in open-source projects and how it can showcase a person's skills to potential employers. Pete also introduced the concept of 'vaults' in Obsidian, explaining that they are used for storing and organizing information, similar to folders. He shared his personal use of 'vaults', such as ones for iOS music production and favorite music, and mentioned his involvement with the AI Entrepreneurs club. 

**Navigating Github: Understanding Its Complexity and Uses** 

Pete Kaminski shared his thoughts on the meeting's outcome and the complexity of Github, likening it to an air traffic control tower due to its tech-centric user base and detailed interface. He guided attendees on how to navigate Github, stressing the importance of the 'read me' file and the 'homepage' of a repository. Jim Sharpe clarified that Github was originally designed for shared code development and has since been adapted for other uses. Pete also mentioned Apple's release of an image editor and its corresponding source code, and the concept of open source and its connection to Microsoft. Towards the end, Pete demonstrated how to find releases and release notes within a repository, and how to run a Python application using Github. 

**exiftool and Digital Photography Discussion** 

Pete Kaminski led a discussion on exiftool, explaining its functionality and how to use it. He clarified that the tool's home page provides clear instructions on how to download and use it, and the file extension '.tar.gz' indicates it's the Unix version of the software. R J inquired about the platform the tool is for, leading to a discussion on identifying software platforms by file extensions. Pete also shared a tech note about the Exf tool on the AI 101 website and discussed metadata in digital photography, emphasizing the importance of privacy. Towards the end, Pete suggested the utility of mid-journey prompts for image creation. 

**Image Generation and History: A Deep Dive** 

R J asked about the consideration of previous pictures and conversational history in generating new images by image large language models. Pete Kaminski clarified that these models don't have a history of previous images, except for specific cases like Chat Gpt, which can understand previous images and modify them. Pete also discussed the use of prompts in image generation, his practice of learning from others' prompts, and the knowledge of the models about the images they generate. He also demonstrated a local image generator, Stable Diffusion, and its advanced settings, mentioning issues with the chat's network connectivity. Towards the end, he discussed the concept of random numbers and seeds in the context of image generation and demonstrated how to obtain a seed for an image using an emoji and an envelope. 

**exiftool and Discord Image Issues** 

Pete Kaminski discussed a potential bug in exiftool, which he initially suspected was causing issues with images downloaded from Discord. However, after careful testing, he discovered that the tool was actually working as expected with these images. He also discussed the use of command line tools and their arguments or flags, using 'exit tool' as an example. Pete mentioned his interest in the Exf tool and its potential for automation. He demonstrated its use with various prompts and shared his plans to sort and evaluate these prompts. However, he acknowledged that his current method was a bit of a 'hot mess' and suggested that he would use a tool like 'emacs' to make the process more organized. 

**Etiquette, Legalities, and Mid Journey Features** 

Pete Kaminski discussed the etiquette of using other people's prompts and the legal implications of using copyrighted images in AI language models. He also demonstrated how to use the mid journey prompt generator and suggested techniques for exploring different prompts and variables. Towards the end of the meeting, R J expressed interest in training a large language model to generate consistent stickman images for storyboarding. Pete mentioned that mid journey has introduced a feature called consistent style which could potentially cater to R J's needs. The topic of character consistency in mid journey was also brought up as a forthcoming feature. 

**AI Education and Collaboration Sessions Planned** 

Pete Kaminski discussed the use of AI to generate consistent styles and the idea of one-on-one AI sessions where people could teach what they know about AI. R J proposed a session with Pi, an AI system, for people to learn from its responses, and shared a rap competition video featuring AI language models. Jim Sharpe agreed to collaborate with Pete on a series of tutorials or demos for the team, focusing on recent work he's been posting to the water cooler discussion. They agreed to keep the sessions short, informal, and off the cuff.
