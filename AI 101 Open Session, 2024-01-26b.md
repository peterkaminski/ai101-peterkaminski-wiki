### Quick Recap

Pete Kaminski led a conversation about a game involving creating a word and asking a chatbot to make three sentences with it, using Chat Gpt and Mid Journey. He also discussed advanced uses of Llms and local llms like Llama file and Mem Gpt. The discussion then shifted to the potential of AI in job hunting and resume writing, with Pete suggesting AI could be more effective as an assistant rather than solely generating a resume. Later, the team discussed the potential advantages of using memGPT over Obsidian for managing and prioritizing tasks.
### Summary

**Word Game, Chatbot Platforms, and LLMS Discussion**

Pete Kaminski led a conversation about a game that involves creating a word and asking a chatbot to make three sentences with it. He shared his experience using Chat Gpt and Mid Journey for this task. Cindy Marie asked for clarification on the differences between the two platforms, with Pete explaining that Chat Gpt integrates Dolly, while Mid Journey is a separate platform. Towards the end, Jeannie Bell experienced technical difficulties. Pete also discussed advanced uses of Llms and local llms like Llama file and Mem Gpt, with contributions from Claire. There was an attempt to share a video, but Pete encountered some technical issues, which R J resolved by suggesting to click on the share sound button.

**AI in Cartoon Creation and Job Hunting**

Pete Kaminski shared the story of Hannah, who, with the help of R J, discovered the potential of AI in the field of cartoon creation. Despite facing numerous obstacles, Hannah's innovative work led to the AI studio becoming a hub for innovation in the animated entertainment industry. The discussion then shifted to the potential of AI in job hunting and resume writing. Pete suggested that while AI could generate a resume, it might be more effective as an assistant, providing advice and guidance on the process. R J agreed with Pete's points, noting the desire to automate tasks related to job searching. However, no clear decisions or next steps were made during the discussion.

**Exploring MemGpt's Language Learning Capabilities**

Pete Kaminski and R J discussed the potential of a new technology, Mem Gpt, which uses a database and instructions to drive Chat Gpt. They explored its language learning capabilities and tested the technology's ability to remember information over multiple conversations. Pete clarified that Mem Gpt externalizes the summary of the internal dialogue, unlike Chat Gpt. R J raised a question about Pete's shift from using Obsidian to AI for learning and tracking purposes, but Pete confirmed he would continue using Obsidian. Pete showed interest in exploring the potential of ChatGPT or MemGpt for task management and prioritization.

**Obsidian vs. memGPT: Potential Advantages and Limitations**

Pete, Claire, Brandon Tidd, and R J discussed the potential advantages of using memGPT over Obsidian. Pete explained that he uses Obsidian for managing and searching text files, highlighting its ease of use and versatility. He also mentioned that he uses chatGPT to sort, search, and merge text files, which he found to be much easier than using an LLM. Brandon Tidd suggested the possibility of integrating chatGPT with Obsidian, which Pete confirmed. The team concluded that while memGPT might take over some functions of Obsidian, it would not be able to replicate all its features.

**Chat TPP Integration and API Key Issues in Obsidian**

Pete Kaminski discussed the integration of Chat Tpp into Obsidian, with a focus on the use of APIs and API keys. He encountered some difficulties, including error messages and issues with visibility of commands. However, he managed to install and activate a text generator, enabling him to generate text on a test page. Cindy Marie was present and provided supportive remarks throughout the process.

**Text Generator Capabilities and Integration With AI in Obsidian**

Pete Kaminski discussed the capabilities of a text generator, highlighting its potential for creating short stories and other forms of content. He also mentioned the use of GPT 4 and its impact on the speed of the text generation process. Dr. Dr. Claire Jacobs added that GPT 3.5 is available for free. Pete further demonstrated the use of the plugin in Obsidian, emphasizing its utility for exporting and organizing conversations. The team also explored the potential of integrating AI functionality like GPT with Obsidian through the use of templates. Pete concluded by highlighting the presence of open-source resources and the collaborative nature of the AI community.

**Image Management and Future Changes Discussed**

Paul, a new user, sought clarity on how to manage and save images generated by the Mid Journey bot. Pete explained the system's functionality, reassuring Paul that his images wouldn't be lost and could be accessed on mid journey.com. He also offered tips on how to better filter and view images, and guided Paul on navigating the system more effectively. Pete also discussed upcoming changes to the platform's interface, its pricing plans, and a feature that allows users to make images private. He also highlighted the potential benefits and challenges of interacting with others' images and prompts. Towards the end, Pete mentioned a feature that allowed for batch saving of images over multiple days, promising to look for the old interface that supported this.
