## Helping Maintain This Website

You can help maintain this website! Send Pete your GitHub account handle (or ask him how to set one up): [[Contact Peter Kaminski]].

Then the typical tools to use are:

- Command line on your computer (Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows)
- Git
- Obsidian
- Git plugin for Obsidian
- gh, then `gh auth login`

Those are listed in rough order of setup/install. Once set up, most of the work is handled within Obsidian.

We'll have more comprehensive setup instructions on this website soon.

## Other Resources

- Pete has additional tutorial videos in the [[Path Shift People Store]]. Prices vary, from $0 and up.
- RJ has a great organized and curated list of resources for getting into AI, at [Meetup Group AI 101 Links](https://mysiteon.yolasite.com/ai101links.php).
