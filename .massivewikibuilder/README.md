# Put Massive Wiki Builder Here

Massive Wiki Builder is a static site generator for turning Massive Wikis into static HTML websites.

To install it, put the files from https://github.com/peterkaminski/massivewikibuilder in this directory.

You also need a theme.  Make a directory for themes (`massive-wiki-themes` is a good name), and add themes to it, one them per directory.  Starter themes can be retrieved from https://github.com/peterkaminski/massive-wiki-themes
