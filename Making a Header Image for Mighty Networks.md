# Making a Header Image for Mighty Networks

For Mighty Network event post header images, they specify an aspect ratio of 21:9.

Equivalent aspect ratios are 7:3 and 28:12.

Further, they note that the bottom 1/4 of the image may be covered, so don't put anything important there.

My (Pete) trick is to use Midjourney to generate an image in the top 3/4 of the 28:12 frame (use `--ar 28:9`), so Midjourney will frame the subjects well, then generatively fill the bottom 1/4 - perhaps with Midjourney, perhaps with another tool like Photoshop. Right now I use Photoshop, because I don't know how to tell Midjourney I want to fill the bottom 1/4, and end up with an aspect ratio of 28:12. It's easy with the crop/expand tool in Photoshop.

Example:

## 28:9

## 28:12 == 7:3 == 21:9
