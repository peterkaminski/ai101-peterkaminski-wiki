# A Caution

You should know that if someone asks your GPT the right way, or uses some other techniques, they may be able to have the GPT output its instructions or even its knowledge sources to them.

You can add instructions to help prevent this, but at the current time, you should assume a determined user will be able to bypass your anti-jailbreak instructions.
