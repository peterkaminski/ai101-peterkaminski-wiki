# Computational thinking

Computational thinking is a problem-solving process that involves thinking logically and efficiently, breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks, and using algorithms to solve them. It involves skills such as abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, and algorithm design.

Computational thinking is not limited to computer science or programming; it can be applied to various domains and everyday life situations. It helps individuals analyze problems, identify patterns, develop step-by-step solutions, and evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches.

By applying computational thinking skills, individuals can approach problems systematically and find efficient solutions. It promotes critical thinking, creativity, and the ability to solve complex problems by leveraging technology and logical reasoning.

Overall, computational thinking is a valuable skillset that enables individuals to tackle challenges in a structured and efficient manner across various domains.
