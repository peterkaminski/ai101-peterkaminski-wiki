## Random Notes

- (feel free to add things in this section)
- Kenneth's Preferred Agenda Items
    - Obsidian
    I have been using .txt format for saving information between sessions and a quick glance at Obsidian shows it too be a great alternative, at least in possibility
    - I have been looking for a text-to-plot and text-to-story tool, esp. freemium

## Living Agenda

- 0h 0m, Check-ins, Questions, Comments, Ideas
- 0h 20m, Text to Story
- 0h 42m, Language Models and Language Model Managers
- 1h 8m, Password Managers

## Password Managers

Requirements:

- different passwords for each system
- creating random passwords
- secure FOR YOUR SITUATION
    - encrypted (?)
- shareable / delegatable to people who might need it
    - in case of incapacity or death
- who takes responsibility in the event of a breach

Nice to have:

- data structure (username, password, one-time password, URL)
- shared among devices
- shared certain passwords with other people (like in a business)
- simple, same interface all the time for keeping any kinds of secret

Password managers Pete trusts:

- 1Password
- Bitwarden
- KeePass (with caveats)

(but I don't use browser plugins for auto logins)

Up and coming:

- Proton Pass

Probably Okay:

- your OS or cloud platform, especially Apple or Google
- your browser, if it's a top-3 browser

Let's talk about:

- pieces of paper
- an offline spreadsheet
- notes app on your phone
- Clipperz
- Add USB Encrypted Drive with passwords, password manager, or second-tier line-item encryption (public-private key)

Don't use:

- ~~LastPass~~
