## AI and Personal Bravery, Curiosity

- need to be a little extra brave to get involved in AI
- but then the AI can help you be a little more brave trying new things
- can use AI as a sounding board
- can use AI to work through imposter syndrome
- can use AI to learn that it's okay to make mistakes, to learn that things don't have to be perfect
- AI makes mistakes, too! :-)
- can be curious with AI, and it doesn't scold you, doesn't judge -- and that makes me even more curious
- "curiosity quotient" (like IQ or EQ)
- do we sometimes chase shiny objects, or let AI be a way to procrastinate?
- AI helps us follow our passions and get more done
