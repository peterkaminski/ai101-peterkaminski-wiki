## Questions, Comments, Ideas

- What are some options for gathering a series of images Iâ€™ve created from Midjourney, and adding captions to each?

### Goals

- post to mighty networks?
- kinda like a story

### Next Steps

- set up a shared Ghost or Substack or Gumroad shared art journal
    
### Options

- post article to MN
    - hard to see images past first image
    - editor is hard
- <https://stories.earthmoonstars.space/>

### Questions / Comments

- API for posting to MN?
- file format conversion, GIF, MP4, WEBP, etc.
    - MN converts GIFs to .avif format
- other platforms for longer form posts, stories, slideshows, etc.

## Coding with LLMs

- RJ's Talking Slideshow and Sitting Timer
- Web APIs
- How big of a system can a non-developer create?
    - example: [campground reservation system](https://chat.openai.com/share/56a18b9f-ea6c-4254-beaf-72e8dde8e1a8)
    - modularization and hierarchy
    - frameworks
    - authentication and authorization
    - database
    - for web apps, "server"
    - Git and GitHub
- What can be made easily with LLM code, and what can't?
- What Web API's can supercharge a custom HTML app (like the Web Speech API)?
- What ideas do we have for making apps with LLM code?
- When does it make sense to use an LLM to create HTML apps vs. Python apps vs. Node apps, etc.?

## Jankifiers
- Junglefy, Lexiconstructor, Chopper
- idea, Cyndi: [Frankifier](https://aisalon.mn.co/posts/jankifier-betterification-project/comments/106320706)
- idea, Pete: Atmosphero
- idea, RJ: Photographic terms - film, lens, etc.
    - [WorldArt Text Modifier](https://ai101.peterkaminski.wiki/jankifiers/worldart_text_modifier)
- [Jankifier Betterification Project - Peter's AI 101](https://ai101.peterkaminski.wiki/jankifier_betterification_project)

### Lexiconstructor ideas

- other languages (but have to worry about swears)
- least commonly used words
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_(Unix)

### Next steps

- Daniele and Pete make a Lexiconstructor with different word lists

## Language Models and Language Model Managers

### Pete's Goals for LLM Users

_will need to be updated as the ecosystems evolve_

* powerful local LLM(s), easily managed
* cheap access to GPT-4 or higher SOTA LLM
* chat interface
* easy export of conversations (ideally to Markdown)
* ease of use
* open source preferred

### Other Benefits

- no tracking or surveillance
- conversations not used for training some company's AI
