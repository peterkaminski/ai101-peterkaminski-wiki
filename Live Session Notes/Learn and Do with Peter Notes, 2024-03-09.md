## "Stack"

(background: like a stack of dishes at a buffet, FIFO queue)

- [x] can we look at some pre-built alternative LLM front-ends
- [x] how hard would the homework be

## Writing a alternative front-end for multiple LLMs

### Rationale - Pros

- have our OWN alternative front-end for cheap "wholesale" access to LLMs via API key
- to see how "simple" it is to use the backend, so that we have a better understanding of "what's under the hood," so we can make better choices about front-ends, back-ends, etc.
- either use Terminal/command-line OR learn simple GUI concepts
- learn how to USE Python (but not KNOW Python)
- learn how to get ChatGPT to write custom Python apps
- know how to start writing other custom front-ends
- other people's front-ends morph, get buggy, go way, etc. in a way that makes them unusable in the future

### Rationale - Cons

- a front-end that we build won't be powerful, maybe?
- API interface may change, meaning our app needs to be upgraded / maintained

### Components

- UI, either **Terminal** or GUI (aka WIMP)
- Programming language, **Python**, Javascript
- Backends
    - **OpenAI** (to start)
    - Anthropic
    - Gemini
