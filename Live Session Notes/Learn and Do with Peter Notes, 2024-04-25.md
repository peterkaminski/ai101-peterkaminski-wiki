## Coding with LLMs

How to make useful custom HTML apps (beyond jankifiers).

What can be made easily with LLM code, and what can't?

What Web API's can supercharge a custom HTML app (like the Web Speech API)?

What HTML apps have others made with LLM code (besides jankifiers)? How did they do it? Can they demo it?

I can quickly explain how I made my talking slide-show HTML app.

What ideas do we have for making apps with LLM code?

when does it make sense to use an LLM to create HTML apps vs. Python apps vs. Node apps, etc.?

And thanks for the pointer to Web APIs! Here is a short list of the ones we could use: Canvas API, Drag and Drop API, Fetch API, File API, Geolocation API, History API, IndexedDB, Service Workers, Web Audio API, Web Speech API, Web Storage API, WebGL, WebRTC, WebSockets.
