## Cove.ai

Kind of like a mashup of Canva, ChatGPT Canvas, and Perplexity.

## AI Life Hacks

- Ask an LLM "As a (persona)" with multiple personas; or, ask to write something for multiple personas at once. You can ask the LLM to "multitask" all in one prompt.
- Use ChatGPT Advanced Voice like it's a friend when you're asking for advice, and it's always friendly and helpful -- you won't get shot down
- When you're depressed (e.g., a cancer patient), chat with Advanced Voice to help pick you up.
- Use AI to help reframe situations to get unstuck, or to feel better about your situation and be more productive. (Pi.ai is especially good at this.)
    - Make a custom instruction shortcut like that asks the LLM to help you reframe.
