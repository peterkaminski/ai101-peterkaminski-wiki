## Learn and Do with RJ, MonsterMash.Zone

- <https://monstermash.zone/>
- MonsterMash.Zone is useful for:
    - 1. morphing images to get the body pose or face expression you want fast and easy
        - then save that image and use it as a reference image for an image model like Dream.AI
        - then the image model will give you the image you want quickly
        - that is a lot easier than prompting to get the image pose or expression you want
    - 2. morphing an image to animate it so you can record the animation as a video or GIF 
        - MonsterMash.Zone animation can be recorded to video using free OBS Studio software
        - then that video can be converted to animated GIF using ezgif.com
    - 3. morphing to animate an image to get a series of images that flow naturally like a basketball player shooting a basket

## Jankifiers

### What They Are

- files, local to your computer, documents, images, spreadsheets
- text files
- text files can be plain text
    - in "text mode", they usually end in .txt
- text files can be HTML
    - in "html mode", they usually end in .html
- HTML pages can be loaded by a web browser as a web page
- HTML pages can include JavaScript programming
- a good LLM can write an HTML file with included JavaScript that does some simple processing, like jankifying an image prompt

### Jankifying Text

- before LLMs, computers were dumb and only knew text as strings of numbers, like a row of kids' blocks
- character numbers are arranged like the alphabet, with an order
- computers can know the difference between letters, uppercase numbers, lowercase numbers, punctuation, white space

### Is It Safe?
- create your own, and use it right from your computer
- create your own, and put it on the web somewhere
    - static website
    - GitHub (not as hard as it sounds)
- use someone else's, check some security things
- don't input sensitive text or information

### More Safety Tips

- have I seen it before? do my friends use it?
- where is it from?
- what is the production value?
- does it look like a scam?
- what have i got to lose? (make sure it's very little)

### Example Prompt

> Create a single HTML file that includes JavaScript. Call it Sortor. Take an input string from the user in a textarea. When the user presses the "Sort" button, alpha sort each word in the string, display the output in an output div, and copy it to the clipboard. Don't use an alert to confirm the copy.
